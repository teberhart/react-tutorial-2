# React tutorial (part 2)
Based on [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsAz5wf2lkK_ekd0J__44KG6QoXetZza) by
[Code Stoic](https://www.youtube.com/@ashutoshpawar) on YouTube.\
However, I really disliked his logic, and how he wrote some things, so I decided to use my own dataset, and not remove
every component as I develop a new one, to be able to see everything done so far on the page.
## Technologies used
- ReactJS : main language that the tutorial aims to teach;
- Vite : package used for the creation and running of our local web server.
## Changes between my version and Code Stoic's version
- I started using a List component right from the start
- Trying to give my variable names a more _professional_ feel
- Not updating forcing updates on my search bar, instead using a button _(That's just so that I don't burn through my
API call limit all the time)_ \
This means that I was able to skip a few videos, so if you see missing tutorials from the commit list, know that it's
probably the reason why.
## Who am I ?
I'm a backend developer, with over 8 years of experience, mostly in PHP. My goal with this project is to learn the
basics of React, to be able to have a fully functioning frontend to my portfolio.\
So yeah, mistakes will probably be made, with my own logic, or with some usage of React, but I'm here to learn. Feel
free to create PRs, explaining why some things are better than others when it comes to React.
