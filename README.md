# React tutorial (part 2)
Based on [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsAz5wf2lkK_ekd0J__44KG6QoXetZza) by
[Code Stoic](https://www.youtube.com/@ashutoshpawar) on YouTube.\
However, I really disliked his logic, and how he wrote some things, so I decided to use my own dataset, and not remove

## Technologies used
- ReactJS : main language that the tutorial aims to teach;
- Vite : package used for the creation and running of our local web server.
## Who am I ?
I'm a backend developer, with over 8 years of experience, mostly in PHP. My goal with this project is to learn the
basics of React, to be able to have a fully functioning frontend to my portfolio.\
So yeah, mistakes will probably be made, with my own logic, or with some usage of React, but I'm here to learn. Feel
free to create PRs, explaining why some things are better than others when it comes to React.
